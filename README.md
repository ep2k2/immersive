日常のスケッチ-EXP (Nichijou no Sketch-EXP) is an experiment into a immersive Japanese language learning activity that creates interactive visual conversations to help users practice Japanese in context. The application generates manga-style panels with dialogue bubbles, allowing users to engage in natural Japanese conversations while practicing a user supplied vocabulary.

# This is a personal experiment as part of Bootcamp activity (see above) - for more details see
